# How to use
1. See `denoise_dialogue.sh` script.
2. Edit the input and output paths according to the source video files you have downloaded in your computer.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder where `denoise_dialogue.sh` script is.
4. Execute the script by typing `bash denoise_dialogue.sh` in your terminal and pressing enter.

NOTE: This denoising might be helpful when the guest microphone is not as good as Peter's. I do not recommend to use this script if the audio quality is high.
